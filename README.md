This project is all about Animation!!!
After following my presentation, you should understand how we can do basic animations with elements using mostly CSS!

Tips:
- As you start the project, make sure to comment out any lines that you are not using yet
- Use comments to label code for each of the project steps
- Check out these references that I used:
    - https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/

Good luck!

Project Steps:
1. Write your own message in the typewriter
2. Animate the button to move the bottom of the screen once
    1a. This should only run ONCE
3. Animate the button to move left to right ENDLESSLY
    2a. This should run an INFINITE amount of times.
4. Animate the button that changes colors in this order(tan,aqua,chartreuse,thistle) 
    3a. This should run an INFINITE amount of times.
5. (BONUS)Animate the button gradually so it eventually has no corners(HINT: Border Radius)
    4a. This should run an INFINITE amount of times.
6. (BONUS)Animate the button to do Steps 2-4 all at the same time.
